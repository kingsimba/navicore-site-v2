TRADEMARK

The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner as a trademark in any jurisdiction. However, because libpng has been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995, the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.

OSI CERTIFICATION:

Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software. OSI Certified Open Source is a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7.

EXPORT CONTROL:

The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain any encryption software. See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and 734.7(b).

LEGAL ISSUES

In plain English:

* We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, please let us know!)
* You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to pay us.
* You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

This software is copyright (C) 1991-2010, Thomas G. Lane, Guido Vollbeding. All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these conditions: (1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation. (2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG Group". (3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought to acknowledge us.

Portions of this software are copyright © 1996-2016 The FreeType Project (www.freetype.org). All rights reserved.

The FreeType Project is distributed in several archive packages; some of them may contain, in addition to the FreeType font engine, various tools and contributions which rely on, or relate to, the FreeType Project.

This license applies to all files found in such packages, and which do not fall under their own explicit license. The license affects thus the FreeType font engine, the test programs, documentation and makefiles, at the very least.

This license was inspired by the BSD, Artistic, and IJG (Independent JPEG Group) licenses, which all encourage inclusion and use of free software in commercial and freeware products alike. As a consequence, its main points are that:

* We don't promise that this software works. However, we will be interested in any kind of bug reports. ('as is' distribution)
* You can use this software for whatever you want, in parts or full form, without having to pay us. ('royalty-free' usage)
* You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it, or only parts of it, in a program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that you have used the FreeType code. ('credits')

We specifically permit and encourage the inclusion of this software, with or without modifications, in commercial products. We disclaim all warranties covering The FreeType Project and assume no liability related to The FreeType Project.
